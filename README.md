# Customer Churn Prediction

## **Overview**
This project focuses on building a Customer Churn Prediction model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The primary goal is to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave) based on historical data, allowing businesses to take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.

## **Dataset**
The project uses the **[Churn Modelling Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubh0799/churn-modelling)** from Kaggle.

## Dataset Features:
- **Demographic Information:** Includes features like age, gender, and geography.
- **Account Details:** Includes credit score, tenure, balance, and number of products.
- **Behavioral Data:** Features like active membership status and credit card ownership.
- **Financial Data:** Estimated salary of the customer.
- **Target Variable:** Indicates whether the customer exited (churned) or not.

## **Techstack**
1. Programming Language - Python
2. Libraries - numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, keras, tensorFlow
3. Version Control - Git, GitHub, VSCode
